# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project
  - `App.jsx`: The main application component
  - `Canvas.jsx`: A component for rendering canvas elements
  - `data.js`: Contains the data used for rendering canvas elements
  - `index.css`: The main stylesheet for the project
